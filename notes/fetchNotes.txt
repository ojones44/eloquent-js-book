Fetching requires the use and knowledge of the following:

[x] Callbacks
[x] Promises
[x] API's
[x] Async/Await
[x] Thenables

1. What is a Callback?

A callback is a function that is passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action with the data in that outer function.

Callback functions had a tendency to cause 'callback hell'. Promises was something that got around this problem.

These are synchronous functions.

2. What are Promises?

A promise will deliver asynchronous code.

JavaScript itself is synchronous, meaning it can only do one thing at a time.

A promise is exactly what it says, it is a promise that it will deliver some data at some point, leaving the program to carry on doing other things

There are 3 states of a promise: Pending, Fulfilled, Rejected.
