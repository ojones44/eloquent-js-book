Empty Values
There are two special values, written null and undefined, that are used
to denote the absence of a meaningful value. They are themselves values,
but they carry no information.

Many operations in JS that donâ€™t produce a meaningful
value yield undefined simply because they have
to yield some value.

null and undefined can be treated the same
